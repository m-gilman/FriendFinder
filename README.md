# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

## Overview

In this activity, I have built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- similar to a dating app. 
This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. 
The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

## Preview the Site here:

## Technologies Used
* Node, NPM
* Express 
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* HTML
* CSS (bootstrap)


## Organization
1. Data - will hold the data that we're storing on the server that contains all of the diff friends someone could be matched up with

2. Public - will contain all of the HTML files to show to the client
    * home.html - the home page 
    * survey.html

3. Routing - will include routes to HTML files to deliver to clients AND API routes that deliver the data from the front to back and back to front.

## Workflow
* The survey has 10 questions. 
* Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
* The user's most compatible friend is determined.
