# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, I have built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- similar to a dating app. 
This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. 
The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

## Technologies Used
* Express is used to handle routing. 
    * body-parser, path, htmlRoutes
* App is deployed to Heroku.
* HTML, CSS, JS, JSON
* Node and NPM

## Workflow
* The survey has 10 questions. 
* Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
* The user's most compatible friend is determined.
